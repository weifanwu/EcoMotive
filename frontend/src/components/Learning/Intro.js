                "Electric vehicles have a rich history dating back to the 19th century. The inception of electric mobility can be traced to inventors like Thomas Davenport and Robert Anderson, who created the earliest electric vehicles.",
                "However, it wasn't until the late 20th century that EVs gained widespread attention.",
                "Whether itâ€™s a hybrid, plug-in hybrid, or all-electric, the demand for electric drive vehicles will continue to climb as prices drop and consumers look for ways to save money at the pump."

                "At the heart of an EV is the electric motor, which is powered by a battery pack. This battery stores electrical energy, providing the necessary power for the motor to drive the vehicle. The charging system replenishes the battery, and regenerative braking harnesses energy during deceleration. The electronic control unit orchestrates these components, ensuring seamless and efficient operation.",

                "Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) have both an internal combustion engine and an electric motor, and they can be plugged in to charge the battery.",
                "Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) have an internal combustion engine and an electric motor, but they cannot be plugged in to charge the battery; instead, the battery is charged through regenerative braking and the internal combustion engine."
